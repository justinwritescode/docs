# UsingsSdk

This SDK provides a way to add reusable `using` statements to your project files, packaged as a NuGet package.  This is useful if you want to declare a set of `using` statements that are used in multiple projects, but you don't want to have to add them to every project file.

## Usage

Simply create a project file with the `usings` you want to reuse and target the `UsingsSdk.`  Then, package the project as a NuGet package and reference it in your other projects.

### Example

#### `MyUsingsPackage.usings`

The target framework is implicitly defined as `netstandard2.0` and the `UsingsSdk` is referenced on the top line.  You can omit the version notation if you include it in your `global.json` file instead.

The package ID is generated as the project name `.Usings.`

```xml title="MyUsingsPackage.usings"
<Project Sdk="UsingsSdk/0.0.2">
  <ItemGroup>
    <Using Include="System.Text" />
    <Using Include="System.Text.RegularExpressions" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

#### `.csproj` Project File

```xml title="MyProject.csproj"
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <TargetFramework>net6.0(1)</TargetFramework>
  </PropertyGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="MyUsingsPackage.Usings" Version="1.0.0" />
    <!-- Implicitly Includes the following: -->
    <Using Include="System.Text" />
    <Using Include="System.Text.RegularExpressions" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

1. The target framework is defined as `net6.0` in this example, but it can be any version of .NET that supports `netstandard2.0`.

Now, this project will have the `usings` defined in the `MyUsingsPackage.usings` file automagiacally!

#### Generated *.GlobalUsings.g.cs

```csharp title="MyProject.GlobalUsings.g.cs"
// <auto-generated/>
// ...
global using global::System.Text;
global using global::System.Text.RegularExpressions;
```
